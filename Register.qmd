### Scholarships: Diversity & Need-Based

A limited number of complimentary registrations are available to enable community members to attend when they would otherwise be unable due to a lack of funding. We place an emphasis on funding applicants who are from historically underrepresented or untapped groups, from low GDP countries, and/or those of lower socioeconomic status.

Tell us why you need one of the limited number of complimentary registrations. Limit 500 characters. 

**Scholarship application deadline:** Friday, April 3rd, 2026

**Scholarship award notification:** Friday, April 10th, 2026
