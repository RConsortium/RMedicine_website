We place an emphasis on funding applicants who are from historically underrepresented or untapped groups, from low GDP countries, and/or those of lower socioeconomic status.

Tell us why you need one of the limited number of complimentary registrations. Limit 500 characters. Submit [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGQ_QqQdOmAvuT_1oLMC_LFVgWeq3NBJ013tVJizklv4bm5g/viewform?usp=header).
