## WHY ATTEND

The R/Medicine conference provides a forum for sharing R based tools and approaches used to analyze and gain insights from health data. Conference workshops and demos provide a way to learn and develop your R skills, and to try out new R packages and tools. Conference talks share new packages, and successes in analyzing health, laboratory, and clinical data with R and Shiny, and an opportunity to interact with speakers in the chat during their pre-recorded talks.
