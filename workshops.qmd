### Mastering Clinical Data Summaries: A Hands-on Workshop with {gtsummary} and AI
::: {.workshop-speakers-name}
Daniel D. Sjoberg & Shannon Pileggi
:::
::: {.workshop-desc}
As the pharmaceutical field increasingly adopts open-source approaches to clinical trial reporting, this seminar highlights the {gtsummary} R package and its integration with the Analysis Results Dataset (ARD) framework as a key advance toward standardized, machine-readable reporting. Participants will learn how to generate ARDs with the {cards} package, create publication-ready tables with {gtsummary}, and see how this ecosystem supports efficient quality control and the use of Large Language Models for code generation and result summarization.

### A Practical Guide to Working with Larger than Memory Data in R
::: {.workshop-speakers-name}
François Michonneau
:::
::: {.workshop-desc}
This hands-on workshop shows R users how to analyze large data efficiently using modern open-source tools while staying within familiar tidyverse workflows. Participants will learn when to move beyond in-memory data frames and how to use DuckDB, Apache Arrow, and duckplyr to work with large CSV and Parquet files, perform joins and aggregations, and accelerate existing dplyr code with minimal changes. Through practical examples, the workshop provides decision frameworks for choosing the right tool based on data size and performance needs, equipping attendees with reproducible strategies to confidently handle larger-than-memory datasets in their own work.

### Creativity, clarity and accessibility: making the most of ggplot2 for data visualisation with R
::: {.workshop-speakers-name}
Cara Thompson
:::
::: {.workshop-desc}
This workshop is designed for ggplot users who know how to make basic graphs, but want to make them look better and save themselves precious time by building reuseable components. We'll explore how to choose the right graphs for different aspects of our data story and how to apply a consistent style across them. In doing so, we will focus on making design choices which are accessible, and on making the most of new ggplot2 features. Because getting from a static graph to an interactive one is much easier than most people realise, we'll finish by exploring how to link two or more interactive graphs together to allow users to explore different aspects of a data story.
This is a code-along workshop, so bring your own data and graphs, and we'll make something fun together.

### LLMs for Data Analysis in R
::: {.workshop-speakers-name}
Sara Altman
:::
::: {.workshop-desc}
LLMs are transforming how we write code, build tools, and analyze data. This workshop will introduce participants to programming with LLM APIs in R using ellmer, an open-source package that makes it easy to work with LLMs from R. We’ll cover the basics of calling LLMs from R, system prompt design, tool calling, and evaluation, and show how to use LLM-powered tools to support common data analysis tasks like exploratory data analysis. Participants will leave with example scripts they can adapt to their own data analysis projects.
