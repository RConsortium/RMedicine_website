## Personal R Administration 

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}

### Description

- Does the release of a new R version fill you with dread?
- Are there passwords in your R code?
- Do you look at the output of a failed package installation and think to yourself, “WTF?!”

If you said yes to any of those questions, then you need Personal R Administration. You'll come away with tips, tricks, tweaks, and some hacks for building data science dev environments that you won't be afraid to come back to in a year.

## teal Mastery: From Pre-built Modules to Custom Module Creation

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}

### Description

This session provides a comprehensive introduction to teal programming, starting with creating a simple teal application from scratch. You'll learn the fundamentals of building a basic teal app and understand its core components. Next, we will explore the practical use of pre-built modules from teal.modules.general and teal.modules.clinical, demonstrating how these ready-to-use components can streamline the development of robust teal applications. Participants will gain hands-on experience in integrating these modules into their projects. The workshop will then focus on building upon this foundation by learning how to create custom teal modules that meet specific project needs. You’ll learn how to leverage the core features of the teal framework to develop tailored solutions and take your skills to the next level. This session will provide practical insights and coding examples, empowering you to extend and customize your teal applications beyond the capabilities of pre-built modules. By the end of this workshop, you will have a comprehensive understanding of both pre-built and custom module development in teal, making it an ideal choice for beginners and intermediate learners looking to expand their R skills with teal.

## Survival analysis with tidymodels


::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}

### Description

Survival analysis is now supported across the tidymodels framework, a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. It covers the entire predictive modeling workflow from data splitting, resampling, feature engineering, model fitting, and performance evaluation to tuning. It provides a consistent interface with composable functions that allow beginners a safe start and advanced users access to more specialized techniques such as feature engineering on text data or tuning via racing methods. 
The addition of dedicated performance metrics has enabled us to support tuning of survival models and unlock the entire framework for survival analysis. This workshop focuses on the core components of tidymodels to get you up and running with predictive survival analysis.
		                                                           
This workshop is for you if you

- are familiar with basic survival analysis such as censoring of time-to-event data, Kaplan-Meier curves, proportional hazards models
- are familiar with the basic predictive modeling workflow such as split in train and test set, resampling, tuning via grid search
- want to learn how to leverage the tidymodels framework for survival analysis
