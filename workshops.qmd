### Description

- Does the release of a new R version fill you with dread?
- Are there passwords in your R code?
- Do you look at the output of a failed package installation and think to yourself, “WTF?!”

If you said yes to any of those questions, then you need Personal R Administration. You'll come away with tips, tricks, tweaks, and some hacks for building data science dev environments that you won't be afraid to come back to in a year.
