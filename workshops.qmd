### Descripción

A pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes. Esta barrera del idioma restringe significativamente el acceso de personas que no hablan inglés con fluidez. Como resultado, las comunidades de habla hispana a menudo enfrentan desafíos considerables para acceder a oportunidades de capacitación en software. Esta disparidad conduce a desigualdades en la distribución y utilización de las tecnologías científicas, lo que es particularmente preocupante dada la creciente importancia de las habilidades digitales en la actualidad. Para mitigar estos desafíos y promover la inclusión, proponemos realizar un taller de programación en español durante la conferencia. Esta iniciativa tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha brindando a los participantes de habla hispana igualdad de oportunidades para interactuar y beneficiarse de los avances tecnológicos. Al hacerlo, no sólo mejoramos las capacidades individuales sino que también contribuimos a una distribución más equitativa de los recursos educativos en la comunidad científica. Este taller equipará a los asistentes con habilidades básicas en R. Nuestro objetivo principal es familiarizar a los participantes con RStudio y sus características clave para generar informes reproducibles. Guiaremos a los asistentes a través del proceso de creación y gestión de proyectos en RStudio y les presentaremos la creación de manuscritos reproducibles utilizando documentos Quarto. El taller utilizará un conjunto de datos disponible públicamente de los CDC, que contiene información sobre el uso de drogas y la ideación suicida entre adolescentes, como un ejemplo práctico del uso de R para la investigación académica en salud pública. Explicaremos cómo utilizar funciones como filtrar, mutar, resumir y seleccionar del conjunto de paquetes tidyverse. Concluiremos demostrando cómo usar ggplot2 para crear visualizaciones en R. Al final del taller, los participantes habrán creado un documento reproducible en formato HTML, detallando los pasos de limpieza de datos y el análisis de un problema social contemporáneo importante. Esta presentación tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha en la alfabetización en programación entre los investigadores de habla hispana y promover métodos para la investigación científica reproducible.

<!-- ### Description -->

<!-- Despite the abundant resources available for learning R, most of these materials are primarily accessible to English speakers. This language barrier significantly restricts access for individuals who do not speak English proficiently. As a result, Spanish-speaking communities often face considerable challenges in accessing software training opportunities. This disparity leads to inequities in the distribution and utilization of scientific technologies, which is particularly concerning given the increasing importance of digital skills nowadays. To mitigate these challenges and promote inclusivity, we propose conducting a programming workshop in Spanish during the conference. This initiative aims to bridge the gap by providing Spanish-speaking participants with equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from technological advancements. By doing so, we not only enhance individual capabilities but also contribute to a more equitable distribution of educational resources in the scientific community. This workshop will equip attendees with basic skills in R. Our primary objective is to familiarize participants with RStudio and its key features for generating reproducible reports. We will guide attendees through the process of creating and managing projects in RStudio and introduce them to creating reproducible manuscripts using Quarto documents. The workshop will utilize a publicly available dataset from the CDC, which contains information on drug use and suicidal ideation among adolescents, as a practical example of using R for academic research in public health. We will explain how to use functions such as filter, mutate, summarize, and select from the tidyverse suite of packages. We will conclude by demonstrating how to use ggplot2 to create visualizations in R. By the end of the workshop, participants will have created a, reproducible document in HTML format, detailing the data cleaning steps and analysis of a significant, contemporary social issue. This presentation aims to close the gap in programming literacy among Spanish-speaking researchers and promote methods for reproducible scientific inquiry. -->

## R package development with GitHub Pages and `pkgdown`

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Description

Creating clear, professional documentation is key to making your R package useful to other people, but building a documentation website can be tricky. The `pkgdown` package makes this process much easier, but deploying via GitHub Pages can present its own set of challenges, especially if you want a highly customized website.

In this workshop, we’ll build a simple R package together, and use GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages to create a `pkgdown` documentation website for the package. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have:

* 🌎 Your package available on GitHub for others to install
* 📄 A polished `pkgdown` website for your package, deployed via GitHub Pages
* 🎨 An understanding of how to customize the trickier components of `pkgdown` websites

Workshop participants should have experience using Git, but don’t need prior experience with GitHub Actions or pkgdown.

Please see the pre-workshop setup steps [here](<files/R package development with GitHub Pages and pkgdown.pdf>).

## Survival analysis with tidymodels

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Description

Survival analysis is now supported across the tidymodels framework, a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. It covers the entire predictive modeling workflow from data splitting, resampling, feature engineering, model fitting, and performance evaluation to tuning. It provides a consistent interface with composable functions that allow beginners a safe start and advanced users access to more specialized techniques such as feature engineering on text data or tuning via racing methods. The addition of dedicated performance metrics has enabled us to support tuning of survival models and unlock the entire framework for survival analysis. This workshop focuses on the core components of tidymodels to get you up and running with predictive survival analysis.

This workshop is for you if you

-   are familiar with basic survival analysis such as censoring of time-to-event data, Kaplan-Meier curves, proportional hazards models
-   are familiar with the basic predictive modeling workflow such as split in train and test set, resampling, tuning via grid search
-   want to learn how to leverage the tidymodels framework for survival analysis

## "Visualise, Optimise, Parameterise!" - Writing dataviz code that your future self will thank you for

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Description

You've collected the initial data, explored the patterns and settled on a few graphs you'll want to create now and in the future as you revisit the dataset from different angles and with new data as it comes in. How can you make sure that the graphs will be as memorable as possible, while also making life easier for your future self? 

In this code-along workshop, we'll work together on our datasets to:

- Settle on the right types of graphs and find colours, fonts and additional styling which complement our storytelling
- Apply these colours, fonts and additional styling to the graphs by creating reusable functions and vectors, avoiding all the copy-pasting we'd end up doing otherwise
- Add annotations straight from the data to highlight patterns and points of interest
- Make the graphs interactive (because why not?)
- Adapt our code to create a function with parameters, which will allow us to apply the same plotting function to any number of future datasets, with a few extra options. 

To get the most out of our workshop, I encourage you to bring a long a dataset and a basic graph (built with ggplot) that you've been working on for it. That should allow you to leave the workshop having made good progress towards a finished publishable product! If you don't have a dataset you can use, don't worry, I'll provide one.

## Rix: reproducible data science environments with Nix

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Description

Reproducibility is a critical aspect of modern research, ensuring that results can be consistently replicated and verified by others. In this workshop, Bruno Rodrigues will introduce participants to Nix, a package manager that focuses on reproducible builds. Unlike other solutions, Nix takes care of all the layers of reproducibility by ensuring that not only R packages are correctly versioned, but also R itself, as well as any other system-level dependency. With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace containerization tools such as Docker, and Nix can be used on any operating system, as well as on CI/CD platforms. To make Nix more accessible to beginners, Bruno wrote an R package called {rix}, which he will cover with hands-on exercices.

## Visualising data for patients: create accessible charts

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Description

Visualising data for patients or other stakeholders may be difficult. Generally, our audience does not have a scientific or medical background, so our duty is to present data in a way that is understandable for them. To create clear and accessible charts, there are several factors to consider, such as decluttering, accessibility of the colour palette, and fonts. During this demo, we will see how to create accessible and clear charts in R. Attendees will learn how to create a new palette in R that is colourblind-friendly, and also how to create an autism-friendly palette.  We will check if the colours in the chart are colourblind friendly in R using colourblind, and we will see how to transform a brand palette into a colourblind friendly palette. Moreover, we will look for fonts that have high readability and see how to include them in our R code.
