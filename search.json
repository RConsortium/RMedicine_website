Take a screenshot and paste the image here: color-blindness-simulator. Be sure to check all the different forms of color vision weakness including Monochromacy/Achromatopsia.\n\n\nConfigure your CodeEditor/IDE\n\nSet the font on your code editor to be large enough that you can read the text from a few feet away.\nIf you use the RStudio or Positron IDE you can make everything larger with cmd + on Mac or ctrl + on Windows.\nIf you work on a large display, take a screen shot showing your code and view it on a 13 inch laptop or tablet.\n\n\n\nShowing Code In Your IDE\n\nRemember that most IDEs can collapse code blocks.\n\nConsider hiding material that you have not talked about yet.\nIf a code block does setup, show it and collapse it.\n\n\n\n\nShowing Code In Slides\n\nConsider highlighting key points as you are taking about them.\nIf you are working in Quarto you can fold/show your code using code chunk options like this:\n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Show the code\"\n\n# code to show goes here\n```\n\nShowing code with line numbers makes it easier for people to ask questions.\nIf you are making slide with Quarto you can draw attention to lines of code with a couple of techniques. Consider these options:\n\nCode Annotation\nCode line highlighting\n\n\n\n\nSlide templates\nR/Medicine slide templates are available for:\n\nPowerpoint. Download the template here.\nQuarto.

Be sure to include template = \"rmed2025\". A slides directory will be created in your current path as defined by here::here() unless you use the path = argument. This demonstration will create the directory evaluated by here::here():\n\nFor example, this code will make a slides folder in your working directory:\n# rUM::write_slides(\"&lt;your presentation name&gt;\", template = \"rmed2025\")\nrUM::write_slides(\"rmed2025_demo\", template = \"rmed2025\")\nIf you are on Mac and want to have a slides folder added to your desktop you can do this:\nrUM::write_slides(\"rmed2025_demo\", path = \"~/Desktop/\", template = \"rmed2025\")\n\nThe slides directory will include:\n\n\n&lt;project&gt;.qmd (The demonstration created rmed2025_demo.qmd)\nslides.scss for presentation styling\nrstudio_default-light.theme that will render your code examples (i.e., syntax highlighting) as displayed in RStudio’s light theme\nimg directory containing template background, hex logo, and .ico file to add styling to your browser’s tab once the presentation is rendered.\n\nNOTE: clean_title_page.html includes JavaScript that modifies elements on the title page only. We recommend against modifying this file.\n\n\n\nRender the document using either the RStudio “Knit” or Positron “Preview” GUI buttons, Ctrl+Shift+K (CMD+Shift+K for macOS), or use the terminal command:\n\nquarto preview slides/&lt;project&gt;.qmd --no-browser\nWe recommend you modify the following values in the presentation YAML:\n\nTitle, subtitle, & author details\nfooter: complete the URL to the project repository for a working HTML hyperlink\n\nAlter the text ([Slides are here]) for a more custom hyperlink at the slide bottom"

You’d be surprised how much environmental noise gets picked up.\nLighting – Do not put lights overhead and don’t put any lights or windows behind you as they will alter the light levels in your videos and create shadows.\nBackground – don’t be afraid to show your natural environment – bookcases, plants, paintings – as long as they are not too distracting.\nFraming – place yourself slightly off-center to the left or right rather than directly in the middle of the frame.\nCamera Height – the lens should either be directly level or pointing ever so slightly downwards towards your face.\nStand – we recommend you stand during your presentation to help project your voice and improve your posture. However, if you’re more comfortable sitting, then please do.\nTimer – Have a clock to keep track of the time you have remaining.\n\nFrom: https://www.greatspeech.co/video-presentations/"

    "text": "Lighting, Webcam and Microphone Best Practices\n\nBest Practices for Lighting\n\nFor best results, use natural light and supplement with additional light as needed.\nKeep natural light in front of you to avoid shadows. A bright window behind you can make you appear as a dark silhouette.\nInterior rooms with no natural light source may require additional targeted lighting, such as a ring light, to brighten the speaker’s face.\n\n\n\nBest Practices for Webcams\n\nTo ensure the speaker is looking directly at the audience, place the webcam at eye level.\nAvoid distracting backgrounds by checking the surroundings behind you to make sure there are no distracting colors or movement.\nPresenters should use chairs that are adjustable for height but do not swivel. Swiveling on camera creates a poor attendee experience and can be distracting.\n\n\n\nBest Practices for Microphones\n\nUse external microphones whenever available, as microphones built into computers and cameras often have lower quality.\nAn external microphone allows the speaker to place it in the optimal location for sound.\nPlace the microphone close to the speaker’s mouth, but not in the camera view.\nTest audio levels in advance.\nManage noise by turning off fans, phones, or speakers and keep ambient noise to a minimum.\nDo not touch the microphone while unmuted\nSend your video to a friend prior to submission to check the sound and video quality\n\n\n\nDress Code\nThere is no dress code for presentations, and we encourage you to be comfortable. That said, you must be aware that the Code of Conduct applies to this space, both in terms of what you show on camera and what you say. We ask that you be tasteful and considerate in choosing your clothing and surroundings. Keep in mind that we are a global community. Please refrain from wearing shirts with global brand logos that are not your own. Solid colors (not white) also work best instead of prints."

    "section": "Live Q&A",
    "text": "Live Q&A\nFor the main meeting on Thursday and Friday, it is required to have a presenter or co-presenter available for the live chat while the pre-recorded talk plays. This is one of the best features of R/Medicine, as the whole community gets to discuss the topic with the speaker during the talk without being rude. It is often helpful to prepare for the live chat by assembling a document with any links, references, etc. that you can copy and paste into the chat when appropriate. This includes links to slides or GitHub repos, as appropriate.\n\nLearn the Content: Familiarity with the content allows a speaker to focus on presenting, rather than trying to remember the points to make. To minimize worry about forgetting elements of the presentation, include notes in your presentation file and have a prepared e-document of your links, script, or talking points that you can paste into the chat.\nPractice Makes Perfect: Speakers should practice their content delivery in the environment in which they will deliver it, such as in front of a computer. Presenting alone to a computer can be awkward at first. To make speakers more comfortable, ask colleagues, roommates, or family to sit in front so they can present to familiar faces.\nUnderstand the Tools: Speakers should understand and utilize the content options available to them, to maximize the effectiveness of the presentation technology. It’s important to know the basic functions of the software, e.g. how to advance slides, manage Zoom Q&A or chats, before the presentation.\nSpeak Up: Check audio levels before presenting, but also make sure to breathe at regular intervals to speak audibly and clearly. Maintaining a clear, even tone throughout the presentation will allow the audience to hear it without adjusting their volume settings.\nLook at Your Camera: If presenting via video, remember, the webcam is your link to your audience. Make eye contact with the camera so it appears to the audience that you are speaking directly to them.\nDon’t Fear Mistakes: Humans make mistakes, even during presentations. Realize that flubs happen and they won’t derail your presentation – unless you let them. Just keep going in your planned presentation and remember, the audience is forgiving.\nBe Prepared: During the presentation, have a glass of water nearby to sip as needed. Also, keep handy a printout of your slides or notes in case you need to refer to them.\n\nFrom: https://www.inxpo.com/assets/pdfs/litepapers/How-To-Be-An-Engaging-Speaker.pdf"

    "text": "KEYNOTE ADDRESSES\n\n\n\nZiad Obermeyer\nReinventing medicine with AI \n\n\nAbstract\nMany medical breakthroughs start with an empirical observation: a curious, unexplained pattern seen in real patients. Underlying mechanisms, unknown at first, are later mapped out in careful experiments. This “bedside to bench” pathway for discovery is less and less common —both because low-hanging fruit has been picked, and because doctors today have little time for observation. I’ll give a few examples of how artificial intelligence can help reboot this pathway: AI is a powerful engine for generating novel empirical observations in real-world data, many of them invisible to the human eye. Translating facts ‘discovered’ by AI into (i) improvements in clinical care and (ii) scientific discoveries are at the core of a new science of medicine, powered by data and computation.\n\n\nBiography\n\nZiad Obermeyer is Associate Professor and Blue Cross of California Distinguished Professor at UC Berkeley. He teaches at School of Public Health and was a founding member of the Berkeley–UCSF joint program in Computational Precision Health. His research uses machine learning to help doctors make better decisions, and help researchers make new discoveries by ‘seeing’ the world the way algorithms do. His work on algorithmic racial bias has been highly influential in shaping how health care organizations and policy makers hold AI accountable, from work with state Attorneys-General to testimony before the Senate Finance Committee. He is a cofounder of Nightingale Open Science and Dandelion Health, a Chan–Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He was named one of the 100 most influential people in AI by TIME Magazine. Previously, he was Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School, and he continues to practice emergency medicine in underserved communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErin LeDell\nModel Evaluation: From Machine Learning to Generative AI\n\n\nAbstract\nAs AI systems grow more complex, the methodologies used to evaluate them must evolve accordingly. Traditional machine learning models are largely deterministic — given the same input, they produce the same output. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems introduce a degree of non-determinism, meaning their outputs can vary even when given identical inputs. This shift challenges conventional evaluation metrics and requires new approaches to assessing model performance, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nThis talk explores the transition from deterministic ML evaluation to the complexities of generative AI assessment. We’ll examine why accuracy-based metrics fall short, how new frameworks address coherence, consistency, and bias, and the challenges of reproducibility in probabilistic AI systems. Finally, we’ll look at how to test AI models in real-world situations, identify where they might go wrong, and make sure they’re safe, reliable, and work as expected. Attendees will gain a clearer understanding of how AI evaluation is changing and practical ways to assess next-generation models.\n\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Erin LeDell is the Chief Scientist at Distributional, Inc. where she’s helping build an automated testing platform for statistical testing of AI applications. She is also the founder of DataScientific, Inc., an AI Advisory and Consulting firm specializing in the development and implementation of cutting-edge AI solutions. Previously, she was the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, and founder of Women in Machine Learning and Data Science (WiMLDS) and co-founder of R-Ladies Global. Erin received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics from University of California, Berkeley and has a B.S. and M.A. in Mathematics."

Participants will have from now until Tuesday, May 20th, 2025 to work on submissions for the challenge. There will be 2 prizes: One $200 prize for the Student Division, and One $200 prize for the Professional Division, as well as a guaranteed spot for each division to present the findings at the 2025 R/Medicine conference. The quality of analyses/Quarto docs, as well as tables and visualizations will be considered.\nChanging attitudes towards vaccination in the US have significantly lowered childhood measles vaccination rates, as uptake of the recommended two doses of MMR vaccine before entering school has frequently fallen below the 95% recommended for community immunity.\n\n\n\nIn this data challenge, you will analyze MMR vaccination rates over time and by geographical area, as well as measles case rates and complications.\nWe ask that all analyses be done and submitted as Quarto documents. Participants can submit as an individual or as part of a team (but not both). The maximum team size is 3. Your goal will be to tell a data story about what is happening with measles immunity and outcomes in the US and the world in 2025.\nWe encourage you to use any and all of the public datasets available at: https://github.com/fbranda/measles. We encourage you to explore any of the csv files at the top level, as well as those in the measles/USA/data/ folder. Note that a lot of the contemporaneous files are updated each week, so be sure to use the latest data in your final submission.\nA special thank you to Francesco Branda, Adjunct professor of the Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology at Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome, for creating and maintaining this valuable repository of measles data.\nAs this is an ongoing concern, datasets are being collected and updated in real time, ad we encourage you to document trends, use interactive formats like ggplotly and shiny-live, and to consider forecasting the future with tools like the {forecast} and {tidyverts} packages. One good reference for forecasting from Rob Hyndman can be found here.\nIn addition to the provided datasets on this Github site, you may request to use additional publicly available data in your submission by submitting a request (with the dataset) by April 29th, 2025 at 5:00PM ET. If approved, the dataset will be made available to all participants.\nYou will be evaluated by judges based on the relevance, completeness, and quality of your submission.\nJudges include:\nRaymond Balise, PhD, University of Miami\nPeter Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc, University of Michigan\nBryan P. Mayfield, PharmD, MS, Precision Analytical\n\n\n\nWhat is the growth rate of measles cases in the US vs Europe?\nAre there particular counties or states at risk due to low vaccination rates?\nHow are vaccination rates changing over time?\nWhat is your projection for the number of measles cases (and complications) in 2026?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen: Now - May 20th, 2025 (submissions accepted through 11:59 PM ET)\nWhere: The R/Medicine data challenge is entirely virtual, with information and rules of the challenge available on this website. Updates will be posted on this website.\nWho you are: We welcome any participants over age 18, especially undergraduate students, graduate students, and early professional data scientists and biostatisticians. Analysts based in academic institutions, government statistical offices, think tanks, policy labs, and community organizations are encouraged to participate. Participants will be asked to submit to either the Student or Professional category, and we may request verification of eligibility for the student category.\nWhat topics you can explore: Participants can analyze the linked measles data sets in tandem with with any other related publicly available data submitted for approval before April 29th, 2025.\nSubmissions and evaluation: Participants will conduct their analyses and submit a short project narrative that describes the research question, analytic approach, and key findings. We encourage participants to find creative ways to incorporate tables, visualizations, and other aspects of data storytelling to create a compelling narrative. In addition to their completed analysis with the indicators they used, participants will be asked to submit documentation describing each step of their process. The documentation should be detailed enough as to make the project fully replicable. The narrative, methods, organization, and documentation of each participant’s project will be evaluated for relevance, completeness, and quality. More information on evaluation will be added to the FAQs section at the bottom of this page.\nNotification: Winners will be notified by Monday May 26th, and will be required to submit the pre-recorded talk on their findings by Monday June 2nd.\n\n\n\nSubmissions will be judged separately in the Student Division (any level of student, including graduate student) and Professional Division (any post-graduate level position). For each division, the prize will include a guaranteed regular talk slot at the 2025 R/Medicine conference to present the findings, as well as a $200 cash prize.\nFinalists will be required to present their project at the R/Medicine conference (must be prerecorded) on the afternoon of Thursday, June 12th, 2025.\n\n\n\n(TBD)\n\n\n\nBest overall: Daniel Gallardo Gomez, Andalusian Health Technology Assessment Department\nHonorable mention: Soham Sinha, University of Chicago\nHonrable mention: Mitchell Maltenfort, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia"

He received his MD degree and a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Pennsylvania, and did his residency in Clinical Pathology at Massachusetts General Hospital, before Fellowship in Transfusion Medicine at Harvard. At CHOP, he is responsible for the development and implementation of new technologies including CAR-T therapy in the Cell and Gene Therapy Laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the release of a new R version fill you with dread?\nAre there passwords in your R code?\nDo you look at the output of a failed package installation and think to yourself, “WTF?!”\n\nIf you said yes to any of those questions, then you need Personal R Administration. You’ll come away with tips, tricks, tweaks, and some hacks for building data science dev environments that you won’t be afraid to come back to in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE. David Aja is a Software Engineer at Posit. Before joining Posit, he worked as a data scientist in the public sector.\n\nShannon Pileggi (she/her) is a Lead Data Scientist at The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, a frequent blogger, and a member of the R-Ladies Global leadership team. She enjoys automating data wrangling and data outputs, and making both data insights and learning new material digestible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis session provides a comprehensive introduction to teal programming, starting with creating a simple teal application from scratch. You’ll learn the fundamentals of building a basic teal app and understand its core components. Next, we will explore the practical use of pre-built modules from teal.modules.general and teal.modules.clinical, demonstrating how these ready-to-use components can streamline the development of robust teal applications. Participants will gain hands-on experience in integrating these modules into their projects. The workshop will then focus on building upon this foundation by learning how to create custom teal modules that meet specific project needs. You’ll learn how to leverage the core features of the teal framework to develop tailored solutions and take your skills to the next level. This session will provide practical insights and coding examples, empowering you to extend and customize your teal applications beyond the capabilities of pre-built modules. By the end of this workshop, you will have a comprehensive understanding of both pre-built and custom module development in teal, making it an ideal choice for beginners and intermediate learners looking to expand their R skills with teal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDony Unardi is a Principal Data Scientist at Genentech, and the Engineering Team Lead in the development effort of an open-source R product called teal, a Shiny-based R package focused on interactive and reproducible data analysis and visualization in clinical trials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvival analysis is now supported across the tidymodels framework, a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. It covers the entire predictive modeling workflow from data splitting, resampling, feature engineering, model fitting, and performance evaluation to tuning. It provides a consistent interface with composable functions that allow beginners a safe start and advanced users access to more specialized techniques such as feature engineering on text data or tuning via racing methods. The addition of dedicated performance metrics has enabled us to support tuning of survival models and unlock the entire framework for survival analysis. This workshop focuses on the core components of tidymodels to get you up and running with predictive survival analysis.\nThis workshop is for you if you\n\nare familiar with basic survival analysis such as censoring of time-to-event data, Kaplan-Meier curves, proportional hazards models\nare familiar with the basic predictive modeling workflow such as split in train and test set, resampling, tuning via grid search\nwant to learn how to leverage the tidymodels framework for survival analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Frick is a software engineer on the tidymodels team at Posit. She holds a PhD in statistics and has worked in interdisciplinary research and data science consultancy. She is a co-founder of R-Ladies Global.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ve collected the initial data, explored the patterns and settled on a few graphs you’ll want to create now and in the future as you revisit the dataset from different angles and with new data as it comes in. How can you make sure that the graphs will be as memorable as possible, while also making life easier for your future self?\nIn this code-along workshop, we’ll work together on our datasets to:\n\nSettle on the right types of graphs and find colours, fonts and additional styling which complement our storytelling\nApply these colours, fonts and additional styling to the graphs by creating reusable functions and vectors, avoiding all the copy-pasting we’d end up doing otherwise\nAdd annotations straight from the data to highlight patterns and points of interest\nMake the graphs interactive (because why not?)\nAdapt our code to create a function with parameters, which will allow us to apply the same plotting function to any number of future datasets, with a few extra options.\n\nTo get the most out of our workshop, I encourage you to bring a long a dataset and a basic graph (built with ggplot) that you’ve been working on for it. That should allow you to leave the workshop having made good progress towards a finished publishable product! If you don’t have a dataset you can use, don’t worry, I’ll provide one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCara is a data visualisation consultant with an academic background, specialising in helping research teams and data-driven organisations turn their data insights into to clear and compelling visualisations.\nFollowing her PhD in Psychology and a spell teaching research methods at Edinburgh Uni, she embarked on a career in psychometrics at the Royal college of Surgeons of Edinburgh. After ten years of helping surgeons and other medical professionals understand complex patterns in exam data, she set out as an independent data visualisation consultant and launched her business “Building Stories with Data”, to continue crafting innovative dataviz solutions for a range of different organisations.\nShe lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with her husband and two young daughters. Cara regularly shares coding tips for dataviz online, and genuinely enjoys helping others level up their dataviz skills through talks, bespoke toolkits, organisational training, and one-to-one coaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes. Esta barrera del idioma restringe significativamente el acceso de personas que no hablan inglés con fluidez. Como resultado, las comunidades de habla hispana a menudo enfrentan desafíos considerables para acceder a oportunidades de capacitación en software. Esta disparidad conduce a desigualdades en la distribución y utilización de las tecnologías científicas, lo que es particularmente preocupante dada la creciente importancia de las habilidades digitales en la actualidad. Para mitigar estos desafíos y promover la inclusión, proponemos realizar un taller de programación en español durante la conferencia. Esta iniciativa tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha brindando a los participantes de habla hispana igualdad de oportunidades para interactuar y beneficiarse de los avances tecnológicos. Al hacerlo, no sólo mejoramos las capacidades individuales sino que también contribuimos a una distribución más equitativa de los recursos educativos en la comunidad científica. Este taller equipará a los asistentes con habilidades básicas en R. Nuestro objetivo principal es familiarizar a los participantes con RStudio y sus características clave para generar informes reproducibles. Guiaremos a los asistentes a través del proceso de creación y gestión de proyectos en RStudio y les presentaremos la creación de manuscritos reproducibles utilizando documentos Quarto. El taller utilizará un conjunto de datos disponible públicamente de los CDC, que contiene información sobre el uso de drogas y la ideación suicida entre adolescentes, como un ejemplo práctico del uso de R para la investigación académica en salud pública. Explicaremos cómo utilizar funciones como filtrar, mutar, resumir y seleccionar del conjunto de paquetes tidyverse. Concluiremos demostrando cómo usar ggplot2 para crear visualizaciones en R. Al final del taller, los participantes habrán creado un documento reproducible en formato HTML, detallando los pasos de limpieza de datos y el análisis de un problema social contemporáneo importante. Esta presentación tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha en la alfabetización en programación entre los investigadores de habla hispana y promover métodos para la investigación científica reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalina Cañizares es una científica de datos apasionada y candidata Ph.D. en trabajo social. Ella se dedidca al uso de datos para obtener información sobre los trastornos emocionales. Ha estado profundizando en el análisis de datos, especialmente con R y su enfoque es hacer que los datos sean comprensibles y útiles. Se especializo en limpiar y fusionar datos, y le encanta explorar datos con herramientas como tidyverse, table1, gtsummary y skimr, entre otras. También se interesa utilizar modelos de Machine Learning, con el paquete tidymodels, para comprender mejor los trastornos emocionales.\n\nFrancisco Cardozo es un candidato a PhD en Ciencias de las Prevención y Salud Comunitaria, se especializa en aplicar técnicas cuantitativas para evaluar la eficacia de programas de prevención, centrándose en entender la dinámica de cómo y para quién estos programas son más efectivos. Está dedicado a desarrollar mediciones y análisis que informen decisiones sobre cómo operar los programas. Francisco siente pasión por traducir hallazgos científicos en aplicaciones prácticas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s best LLMs are incredibly powerful–but you’re only scratching the surface of their capabilities if your use is limited to ChatGPT or Copilot. Accessing LLMs programmatically opens up a whole new world of possibilities, letting you integrate LLMs into your own apps, scripts, and workflows. In this workshop, we’ll cover:\n\nA practical introduction to LLM APIs\nConfiguring R to access LLMs via the ellmer package\nCustomizing LLM behavior using system prompts and tool calling\nCreating Shiny apps with integrated chatbots\nUsing LLMs for natural language processing\n\nAttendees will leave the workshop armed with ready-to-run examples, and the confidence and inspiration to run their own experiments with LLMs.\nAttendees should be familiar with the basics of R and have a working R installation.\nNote that this workshop requires access to an OpenAI/Anthropic API key. Participants will need to indicate interest in this workshop in advance to receive one from the workshop host\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Cheng is the CTO of Posit, PBC. He’s the original creator of the Shiny web framework and co-creator of ellmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating clear, professional documentation is key to making your R package useful to other people, but building a documentation website can be tricky. The pkgdown package makes this process much easier, but deploying via GitHub Pages can present its own set of challenges, especially if you want a highly customized website.\nIn this workshop, we’ll build a simple R package together, and use GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages to create a pkgdown documentation website for the package. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have:\n\n🌎 Your package available on GitHub for others to install\n📄 A polished pkgdown website for your package, deployed via GitHub Pages\n🎨 An understanding of how to customize the trickier components of pkgdown websites\n\nWorkshop participants should have experience using Git, but don’t need prior experience with GitHub Actions or pkgdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelissa Van Bussel is a Senior Data Analyst at Statistics Canada, where she develops and delivers training about open-source languages and tools. She also helps run a large R and Python User Group at Statistics Canada. Outside of work, she creates educational videos on YouTube (@ggnot2) about R and data science, and is an organizer for R-Ladies Ottawa. Melissa is an Accredited Associate Statistician, and received her M. Sc. in Statistics from Carleton University and has a B. Sc. H. in Mathematics and Computing Systems from Trent University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility is a critical aspect of modern research, ensuring that results can be consistently replicated and verified by others. In this workshop, Bruno Rodrigues will introduce participants to Nix, a package manager that focuses on reproducible builds. Unlike other solutions, Nix takes care of all the layers of reproducibility by ensuring that not only R packages are correctly versioned, but also R itself, as well as any other system-level dependency. With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace containerization tools such as Docker, and Nix can be used on any operating system, as well as on CI/CD platforms. To make Nix more accessible to beginners, Bruno wrote an R package called {rix}, which he will cover with hands-on exercices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruno Rodrigues is a statistician at Luxembourg’s Ministry of Research and Higher Education. He has also worked as a senior data scientist and managed the data science team at PwC Luxembourg, following a period as a research assistant at STATEC Research.\nBruno is keenly interested in reproducibility and works on developing tools and writing tutorials that help others improve their research practices. He is the author of Building Reproducible Analytical Pipelines with R and contributes to the R ecosystem for Nix, a package manager focused on reproducible builds."

    "text": "Survival analysis is now supported across the tidymodels framework, a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. It covers the entire predictive modeling workflow from data splitting, resampling, feature engineering, model fitting, and performance evaluation to tuning. It provides a consistent interface with composable functions that allow beginners a safe start and advanced users access to more specialized techniques such as feature engineering on text data or tuning via racing methods. The addition of dedicated performance metrics has enabled us to support tuning of survival models and unlock the entire framework for survival analysis. This workshop focuses on the core components of tidymodels to get you up and running with predictive survival analysis.\nThis workshop is for you if you\n\nare familiar with basic survival analysis such as censoring of time-to-event data, Kaplan-Meier curves, proportional hazards models\nare familiar with the basic predictive modeling workflow such as split in train and test set, resampling, tuning via grid search\nwant to learn how to leverage the tidymodels framework for survival analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Frick is a software engineer on the tidymodels team at Posit.

How can you make sure that the graphs will be as memorable as possible, while also making life easier for your future self?\nIn this code-along workshop, we’ll work together on our datasets to:\n\nSettle on the right types of graphs and find colours, fonts and additional styling which complement our storytelling\nApply these colours, fonts and additional styling to the graphs by creating reusable functions and vectors, avoiding all the copy-pasting we’d end up doing otherwise\nAdd annotations straight from the data to highlight patterns and points of interest\nMake the graphs interactive (because why not?)\nAdapt our code to create a function with parameters, which will allow us to apply the same plotting function to any number of future datasets, with a few extra options.\n\nTo get the most out of our workshop, I encourage you to bring a long a dataset and a basic graph (built with ggplot) that you’ve been working on for it. That should allow you to leave the workshop having made good progress towards a finished publishable product!

    "text": "A pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes. Esta barrera del idioma restringe significativamente el acceso de personas que no hablan inglés con fluidez. Como resultado, las comunidades de habla hispana a menudo enfrentan desafíos considerables para acceder a oportunidades de capacitación en software. Esta disparidad conduce a desigualdades en la distribución y utilización de las tecnologías científicas, lo que es particularmente preocupante dada la creciente importancia de las habilidades digitales en la actualidad. Para mitigar estos desafíos y promover la inclusión, proponemos realizar un taller de programación en español durante la conferencia. Esta iniciativa tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha brindando a los participantes de habla hispana igualdad de oportunidades para interactuar y beneficiarse de los avances tecnológicos. Al hacerlo, no sólo mejoramos las capacidades individuales sino que también contribuimos a una distribución más equitativa de los recursos educativos en la comunidad científica. Este taller equipará a los asistentes con habilidades básicas en R. Nuestro objetivo principal es familiarizar a los participantes con RStudio y sus características clave para generar informes reproducibles. Guiaremos a los asistentes a través del proceso de creación y gestión de proyectos en RStudio y les presentaremos la creación de manuscritos reproducibles utilizando documentos Quarto. El taller utilizará un conjunto de datos disponible públicamente de los CDC, que contiene información sobre el uso de drogas y la ideación suicida entre adolescentes, como un ejemplo práctico del uso de R para la investigación académica en salud pública. Explicaremos cómo utilizar funciones como filtrar, mutar, resumir y seleccionar del conjunto de paquetes tidyverse. Concluiremos demostrando cómo usar ggplot2 para crear visualizaciones en R. Al final del taller, los participantes habrán creado un documento reproducible en formato HTML, detallando los pasos de limpieza de datos y el análisis de un problema social contemporáneo importante. Esta presentación tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha en la alfabetización en programación entre los investigadores de habla hispana y promover métodos para la investigación científica reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalina Cañizares es una científica de datos apasionada y candidata Ph.D. en trabajo social.
