    "text": "KEYNOTE ADDRESSES\n\n\n\nZiad Obermeyer\nReinventing medicine with AI\n\n\nAbstract\nMany medical breakthroughs start with an empirical observation: a curious, unexplained pattern seen in real patients. Underlying mechanisms, unknown at first, are later mapped out in careful experiments. This “bedside to bench” pathway for discovery is less and less common —both because low-hanging fruit has been picked, and because doctors today have little time for observation. I’ll give a few examples of how artificial intelligence can help reboot this pathway: AI is a powerful engine for generating novel empirical observations in real-world data, many of them invisible to the human eye. Translating facts ‘discovered’ by AI into (i) improvements in clinical care and (ii) scientific discoveries are at the core of a new science of medicine, powered by data and computation.\n\n\nBiography\n\nZiad Obermeyer is Associate Professor and Blue Cross of California Distinguished Professor at UC Berkeley. He teaches at School of Public Health and was a founding member of the Berkeley–UCSF joint program in Computational Precision Health. His research uses machine learning to help doctors make better decisions, and help researchers make new discoveries by ‘seeing’ the world the way algorithms do. His work on algorithmic racial bias has been highly influential in shaping how health care organizations and policy makers hold AI accountable, from work with state Attorneys-General to testimony before the Senate Finance Committee. He is a cofounder of Nightingale Open Science and Dandelion Health, a Chan–Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He was named one of the 100 most influential people in AI by TIME Magazine. Previously, he was Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School, and he continues to practice emergency medicine in underserved communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErin LeDell\nModel Evaluation: From Machine Learning to Generative AI\n\n\nAbstract\nAs AI systems grow more complex, the methodologies used to evaluate them must evolve accordingly. Traditional machine learning models are largely deterministic — given the same input, they produce the same output. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems introduce a degree of non-determinism, meaning their outputs can vary even when given identical inputs. This shift challenges conventional evaluation metrics and requires new approaches to assessing model performance, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nThis talk explores the transition from deterministic ML evaluation to the complexities of generative AI assessment. We’ll examine why accuracy-based metrics fall short, how new frameworks address coherence, consistency, and bias, and the challenges of reproducibility in probabilistic AI systems. Finally, we’ll look at how to test AI models in real-world situations, identify where they might go wrong, and make sure they’re safe, reliable, and work as expected. Attendees will gain a clearer understanding of how AI evaluation is changing and practical ways to assess next-generation models.\n\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Erin LeDell is the Chief Scientist at Distributional, Inc. where she’s helping build an automated testing platform for statistical testing of AI applications. She is also the founder of DataScientific, Inc., an AI Advisory and Consulting firm specializing in the development and implementation of cutting-edge AI solutions. Previously, she was the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, and founder of Women in Machine Learning and Data Science (WiMLDS) and co-founder of R-Ladies Global. Erin received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics from University of California, Berkeley and has a B.S. and M.A. in Mathematics."

    "text": "This page is intended for folks who have had their abstract accepted for a lightning talk or regular talk at R/Medicine 2025. Congratulations! We are excited to welcome you as a presenter. As a reminder, the event will take place virtually on Thursday and Friday, June 13-14, on Eastern Daylight Time. Please click through the tabs on this page to access information.\n\n\n\n\nPre-Recording Video Submission Due Date (mandatory for lightning talks, recommended for regular talks with only one speaker): Monday, June 2\nSpeaker Training (for all who will present live): TBD\nEvent Dates: Monday, June 9 – Friday, June 13\nTimezone: Eastern Daylight Time\n\n\n\n\nThe schedule has been posted on the R/Medicine web site.\nAll lightning talks are ten (10) minutes in total (including Q&A).\nAll regular talks are twenty (20) minutes in total (including Q&A).\n\n\n\nWe will be using the virtual platform Zoom that will allow speakers to deliver content live or by pre-recorded talk, and join the chat live (and drop links into the chat) for Q&A during the session.\nWorkshops and demos are best delivered live, though it can help to have a co-presenter monitoring the chat for questions.\nFor the main meeting on Thursday and Friday, it is best to have a presenter or co-presenter available for the live chat. This is one of the best features of R/Medicine, as the whole community gets to discuss the topic with the speaker during the talk without being rude. It really helps to have a co-presenter running the live chat, or to pre-record your talk so that you can participate in the live chat.\nIt is often helpful to prepare for the live chat by assembling a document with any links, references, etc. that you can copy and paste into the chat when appropriate.\n\n\n\nAll regular talk and lightning talk speakers may pre-record their talk, which will be played through the event platform. Speakers who will give a lightning talk must submit a pre-recorded talk.\nSome suggested tools to use for recording are Quicktime, Zoom, a screen recorder, or something similar. The recording should show your slides or screen and optionally yourself, using a picture in picture style format. Please share the actual video file, in MP4 format, not a link to a streaming service such as YouTube or Vimeo. Email this recording to us at info@r-consortium.org by midnight EDT on June 2.\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions.\n\n\n\nAs with physical events, live interaction is essential to the success of virtual events and we are asking every presenter, whether presenting live or via pre-recorded session, to join for live chat with attendees during their session, within the platform. This will provide added value to the audience and create more of an ‘event’ experience.\nIf you are concerned about your timezone and how that could impact the live Q&A portion of your session, we will do our best to reschedule your session slot to a time that is convenient for you. Reach out to us if needed at r-medicine-conf@r-consortium.org\n\n\n\n\nAudio – as counterintuitive as it may sound, the single most important factor in a good video, is the audio quality.\nEliminate ambient noise – close the doors and windows. You’d be surprised how much environmental noise gets picked up.\nLighting – Do not put lights overhead and don’t put any lights or windows behind you as they will alter the light levels in your videos and create shadows.\nBackground – don’t be afraid to show your natural environment – bookcases, plants, paintings – as long as they are not too distracting.\nFraming – place yourself slightly off-center to the left or right rather than directly in the middle of the frame.\nCamera Height – the lens should either be directly level or pointing ever so slightly downwards towards your face.\nStand – we recommend you stand during your presentation to help project your voice and improve your posture. However, if you’re more comfortable sitting, then please do.\nTimer – Have a clock to keep track of the time you have remaining.\n\nFrom: https://www.greatspeech.co/video-presentations/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor best results, use natural light and supplement with additional light as needed.\nKeep natural light in front of you to avoid shadows. A bright window behind you can make you appear as a dark silhouette.\nInterior rooms with no natural light source may require additional targeted lighting, such as a ring light, to brighten the speaker’s face.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure the speaker is looking directly at the audience, place the webcam at eye level.\nAvoid distracting backgrounds by checking the surroundings behind you to make sure there are no distracting colors or movement.\nPresenters should use chairs that are adjustable for height but do not swivel. Swiveling on camera creates a poor attendee experience and can be distracting.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse external microphones whenever available, as microphones built into computers and cameras often have lower quality.\nAn external microphone allows the speaker to place it in the optimal location for sound.\nPlace the microphone close to the speaker’s mouth, but not in the camera view.\nTest audio levels in advance.\nManage noise by turning off fans, phones, or speakers and keep ambient noise to a minimum.\nDo not touch the microphone while unmuted\n\n\n\n\nThere is no dress code for presentations, and we encourage you to be comfortable. That said, you must be aware that the Code of Conduct applies to this space, both in terms of what you show on camera and what you say. We ask that you be tasteful and considerate in choosing your clothing and surroundings. Keep in mind that we are a global community. Please refrain from wearing shirts with global brand logos that are not your own. Solid colors (not white) also work best instead of prints.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn the Content: Familiarity with the content allows a speaker to focus on presenting, rather than trying to remember the points to make. To minimize worry about forgetting elements of the presentation, include notes in your presentation file and have a prepared e-document of your links, script, or talking points that you can paste into the chat.\nPractice Makes Perfect: Speakers should practice their content delivery in the environment in which they will deliver it, such as in front of a computer. Presenting alone to a computer can be awkward at first. To make speakers more comfortable, ask colleagues, roommates, or family to sit in front so they can present to familiar faces.\nUnderstand the Tools: Speakers should understand and utilize the content options available to them, to maximize the effectiveness of the presentation technology. It’s important to know the basic functions of the software, e.g. how to advance slides, manage Zoom Q&A or chats, before the presentation.\nSpeak Up: Check audio levels before presenting, but also make sure to breathe at regular intervals to speak audibly and clearly. Maintaining a clear, even tone throughout the presentation will allow the audience to hear it without adjusting their volume settings.\nLook at Your Camera: If presenting via video, remember, the webcam is your link to your audience. Make eye contact with the camera so it appears to the audience that you are speaking directly to them.\nDon’t Fear Mistakes: Humans make mistakes, even during presentations. Realize that flubs happen and they won’t derail your presentation – unless you let them. Just keep going in your planned presentation and remember, the audience is forgiving.\nBe Prepared: During the presentation, have a glass of water nearby to sip as needed. Also, keep handy a printout of your slides or notes in case you need to refer to them.\n\nFrom: https://www.inxpo.com/assets/pdfs/litepapers/How-To-Be-An-Engaging-Speaker.pdf\n\n\n\nThe Linux Foundation, in collaboration with the National Center for Women in Technology (NCWIT), has created an online course designed to teach the viewer about inclusion, diversity, and unconscious bias. We highly recommend all of our speakers, watch the course to learn tips/tools to use when speaking to encourage inclusivity in presentations and messaging.\n\n\n\nPlease read and abide by our code of conduct, which can be found here. We ask that speakers especially review this code of conduct and are inclusive in the words and images used during their presentation.\n\n\n\n\nBest Gear for Online Meetings – Webcams, lights, mics, tripods and more\n19 Video Presentation Tips to help you give a great presentation (even if you hate the way you look on camera)\n9 Tips for Giving Engaging Virtual Presentations – This article gives 9 tips and within each tip has folks from the tech world giving their advice in a fun/relatable way.\nPACE Acronym for Virtual Presentations\nChecklist for Speakers – this article provides checklists applicable for speakers that are live streaming.\n\n\n\nIf you have any other platform, speaker, or schedule-related questions, please contact us at r-medicine-conf@r-consortium.org."

Swiveling on camera creates a poor attendee experience and can be distracting.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse external microphones whenever available, as microphones built into computers and cameras often have lower quality.\nAn external microphone allows the speaker to place it in the optimal location for sound.\nPlace the microphone close to the speaker’s mouth, but not in the camera view.\nTest audio levels in advance.\nManage noise by turning off fans, phones, or speakers and keep ambient noise to a minimum.\nDo not touch the microphone while unmuted\n\n\n\n\nThere is no dress code for presentations, and we encourage you to be comfortable. That said, you must be aware that the Code of Conduct applies to this space, both in terms of what you show on camera and what you say.

    "text": "Learn the Content: Familiarity with the content allows a speaker to focus on presenting, rather than trying to remember the points to make. To minimize worry about forgetting elements of the presentation, include notes in your presentation file and have a prepared e-document of your links, script, or talking points that you can paste into the chat.\nPractice Makes Perfect: Speakers should practice their content delivery in the environment in which they will deliver it, such as in front of a computer. Presenting alone to a computer can be awkward at first. To make speakers more comfortable, ask colleagues, roommates, or family to sit in front so they can present to familiar faces.\nUnderstand the Tools: Speakers should understand and utilize the content options available to them, to maximize the effectiveness of the presentation technology. It’s important to know the basic functions of the software, e.g. how to advance slides, manage Zoom Q&A or chats, before the presentation.\nSpeak Up: Check audio levels before presenting, but also make sure to breathe at regular intervals to speak audibly and clearly. Maintaining a clear, even tone throughout the presentation will allow the audience to hear it without adjusting their volume settings.\nLook at Your Camera: If presenting via video, remember, the webcam is your link to your audience. Make eye contact with the camera so it appears to the audience that you are speaking directly to them.\nDon’t Fear Mistakes: Humans make mistakes, even during presentations. Realize that flubs happen and they won’t derail your presentation – unless you let them. Just keep going in your planned presentation and remember, the audience is forgiving.\nBe Prepared: During the presentation, have a glass of water nearby to sip as needed. Also, keep handy a printout of your slides or notes in case you need to refer to them.\n\nFrom: https://www.inxpo.com/assets/pdfs/litepapers/How-To-Be-An-Engaging-Speaker.pdf"

It covers the entire predictive modeling workflow from data splitting, resampling, feature engineering, model fitting, and performance evaluation to tuning. It provides a consistent interface with composable functions that allow beginners a safe start and advanced users access to more specialized techniques such as feature engineering on text data or tuning via racing methods. The addition of dedicated performance metrics has enabled us to support tuning of survival models and unlock the entire framework for survival analysis. This workshop focuses on the core components of tidymodels to get you up and running with predictive survival analysis.\nThis workshop is for you if you\n\nare familiar with basic survival analysis such as censoring of time-to-event data, Kaplan-Meier curves, proportional hazards models\nare familiar with the basic predictive modeling workflow such as split in train and test set, resampling, tuning via grid search\nwant to learn how to leverage the tidymodels framework for survival analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Frick is a software engineer on the tidymodels team at Posit.

She is a co-founder of R-Ladies Global.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ve collected the initial data, explored the patterns and settled on a few graphs you’ll want to create now and in the future as you revisit the dataset from different angles and with new data as it comes in. How can you make sure that the graphs will be as memorable as possible, while also making life easier for your future self?\nIn this code-along workshop, we’ll work together on our datasets to:\n\nSettle on the right types of graphs and find colours, fonts and additional styling which complement our storytelling\nApply these colours, fonts and additional styling to the graphs by creating reusable functions and vectors, avoiding all the copy-pasting we’d end up doing otherwise\nAdd annotations straight from the data to highlight patterns and points of interest\nMake the graphs interactive (because why not?)\nAdapt our code to create a function with parameters, which will allow us to apply the same plotting function to any number of future datasets, with a few extra options.\n\nTo get the most out of our workshop, I encourage you to bring a long a dataset and a basic graph (built with ggplot) that you’ve been working on for it. That should allow you to leave the workshop having made good progress towards a finished publishable product!

Cara regularly shares coding tips for dataviz online, and genuinely enjoys helping others level up their dataviz skills through talks, bespoke toolkits, organisational training, and one-to-one coaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes. Esta barrera del idioma restringe significativamente el acceso de personas que no hablan inglés con fluidez. Como resultado, las comunidades de habla hispana a menudo enfrentan desafíos considerables para acceder a oportunidades de capacitación en software. Esta disparidad conduce a desigualdades en la distribución y utilización de las tecnologías científicas, lo que es particularmente preocupante dada la creciente importancia de las habilidades digitales en la actualidad. Para mitigar estos desafíos y promover la inclusión, proponemos realizar un taller de programación en español durante la conferencia. Esta iniciativa tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha brindando a los participantes de habla hispana igualdad de oportunidades para interactuar y beneficiarse de los avances tecnológicos. Al hacerlo, no sólo mejoramos las capacidades individuales sino que también contribuimos a una distribución más equitativa de los recursos educativos en la comunidad científica. Este taller equipará a los asistentes con habilidades básicas en R. Nuestro objetivo principal es familiarizar a los participantes con RStudio y sus características clave para generar informes reproducibles. Guiaremos a los asistentes a través del proceso de creación y gestión de proyectos en RStudio y les presentaremos la creación de manuscritos reproducibles utilizando documentos Quarto. El taller utilizará un conjunto de datos disponible públicamente de los CDC, que contiene información sobre el uso de drogas y la ideación suicida entre adolescentes, como un ejemplo práctico del uso de R para la investigación académica en salud pública. Explicaremos cómo utilizar funciones como filtrar, mutar, resumir y seleccionar del conjunto de paquetes tidyverse. Concluiremos demostrando cómo usar ggplot2 para crear visualizaciones en R. Al final del taller, los participantes habrán creado un documento reproducible en formato HTML, detallando los pasos de limpieza de datos y el análisis de un problema social contemporáneo importante. Esta presentación tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha en la alfabetización en programación entre los investigadores de habla hispana y promover métodos para la investigación científica reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalina Cañizares es una científica de datos apasionada y candidata Ph.D. en trabajo social. Ella se dedidca al uso de datos para obtener información sobre los trastornos emocionales. Ha estado profundizando en el análisis de datos, especialmente con R y su enfoque es hacer que los datos sean comprensibles y útiles. Se especializo en limpiar y fusionar datos, y le encanta explorar datos con herramientas como tidyverse, table1, gtsummary y skimr, entre otras. También se interesa utilizar modelos de Machine Learning, con el paquete tidymodels, para comprender mejor los trastornos emocionales.\n\nFrancisco Cardozo es un candidato a PhD en Ciencias de las Prevención y Salud Comunitaria, se especializa en aplicar técnicas cuantitativas para evaluar la eficacia de programas de prevención, centrándose en entender la dinámica de cómo y para quién estos programas son más efectivos. Está dedicado a desarrollar mediciones y análisis que informen decisiones sobre cómo operar los programas. Francisco siente pasión por traducir hallazgos científicos en aplicaciones prácticas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s best LLMs are incredibly powerful–but you’re only scratching the surface of their capabilities if your use is limited to ChatGPT or Copilot. Accessing LLMs programmatically opens up a whole new world of possibilities, letting you integrate LLMs into your own apps, scripts, and workflows. In this workshop, we’ll cover:\n\nA practical introduction to LLM APIs\nConfiguring R to access LLMs via the ellmer package\nCustomizing LLM behavior using system prompts and tool calling\nCreating Shiny apps with integrated chatbots\nUsing LLMs for natural language processing\n\nAttendees will leave the workshop armed with ready-to-run examples, and the confidence and inspiration to run their own experiments with LLMs.\nAttendees should be familiar with the basics of R and have a working R installation.\nNote that this workshop requires access to an OpenAI/Anthropic API key. Participants have the option to obtain their own (credit card required, will incur small fee during workshop (&lt;&lt;1USD) but will retain long-term access) or to provide their email in advance to receive one from the workshop host\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Cheng is the CTO of Posit, PBC. He’s the original creator of the Shiny web framework and co-creator of ellmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating clear, professional documentation is key to making your R package useful to other people, but building a documentation website can be tricky. The pkgdown package makes this process much easier, but deploying via GitHub Pages can present its own set of challenges, especially if you want a highly customized website.\nIn this workshop, we’ll build a simple R package together, and use GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages to create a pkgdown documentation website for the package. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have:\n\n🌎 Your package available on GitHub for others to install\n📄 A polished pkgdown website for your package, deployed via GitHub Pages\n🎨 An understanding of how to customize the trickier components of pkgdown websites\n\nWorkshop participants should have experience using Git, but don’t need prior experience with GitHub Actions or pkgdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelissa Van Bussel is a Senior Data Analyst at Statistics Canada, where she develops and delivers training about open-source languages and tools. She also helps run a large R and Python User Group at Statistics Canada. Outside of work, she creates educational videos on YouTube (@ggnot2) about R and data science, and is an organizer for R-Ladies Ottawa. Melissa is an Accredited Associate Statistician, and received her M. Sc. in Statistics from Carleton University and has a B. Sc. H. in Mathematics and Computing Systems from Trent University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility is a critical aspect of modern research, ensuring that results can be consistently replicated and verified by others. In this workshop, Bruno Rodrigues will introduce participants to Nix, a package manager that focuses on reproducible builds. Unlike other solutions, Nix takes care of all the layers of reproducibility by ensuring that not only R packages are correctly versioned, but also R itself, as well as any other system-level dependency. With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace containerization tools such as Docker, and Nix can be used on any operating system, as well as on CI/CD platforms. To make Nix more accessible to beginners, Bruno wrote an R package called {rix}, which he will cover with hands-on exercices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruno Rodrigues is a statistician at Luxembourg’s Ministry of Research and Higher Education. He has also worked as a senior data scientist and managed the data science team at PwC Luxembourg, following a period as a research assistant at STATEC Research.\nBruno is keenly interested in reproducibility and works on developing tools and writing tutorials that help others improve their research practices. He is the author of Building Reproducible Analytical Pipelines with R and contributes to the R ecosystem for Nix, a package manager focused on reproducible builds."

    "text": "You’ve collected the initial data, explored the patterns and settled on a few graphs you’ll want to create now and in the future as you revisit the dataset from different angles and with new data as it comes in. How can you make sure that the graphs will be as memorable as possible, while also making life easier for your future self?\nIn this code-along workshop, we’ll work together on our datasets to:\n\nSettle on the right types of graphs and find colours, fonts and additional styling which complement our storytelling\nApply these colours, fonts and additional styling to the graphs by creating reusable functions and vectors, avoiding all the copy-pasting we’d end up doing otherwise\nAdd annotations straight from the data to highlight patterns and points of interest\nMake the graphs interactive (because why not?)\nAdapt our code to create a function with parameters, which will allow us to apply the same plotting function to any number of future datasets, with a few extra options.\n\nTo get the most out of our workshop, I encourage you to bring a long a dataset and a basic graph (built with ggplot) that you’ve been working on for it. That should allow you to leave the workshop having made good progress towards a finished publishable product! If you don’t have a dataset you can use, don’t worry, I’ll provide one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCara is a data visualisation consultant with an academic background, specialising in helping research teams and data-driven organisations turn their data insights into to clear and compelling visualisations.\nFollowing her PhD in Psychology and a spell teaching research methods at Edinburgh Uni, she embarked on a career in psychometrics at the Royal college of Surgeons of Edinburgh.

    "text": "A pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes. Esta barrera del idioma restringe significativamente el acceso de personas que no hablan inglés con fluidez. Como resultado, las comunidades de habla hispana a menudo enfrentan desafíos considerables para acceder a oportunidades de capacitación en software. Esta disparidad conduce a desigualdades en la distribución y utilización de las tecnologías científicas, lo que es particularmente preocupante dada la creciente importancia de las habilidades digitales en la actualidad. Para mitigar estos desafíos y promover la inclusión, proponemos realizar un taller de programación en español durante la conferencia. Esta iniciativa tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha brindando a los participantes de habla hispana igualdad de oportunidades para interactuar y beneficiarse de los avances tecnológicos. Al hacerlo, no sólo mejoramos las capacidades individuales sino que también contribuimos a una distribución más equitativa de los recursos educativos en la comunidad científica. Este taller equipará a los asistentes con habilidades básicas en R. Nuestro objetivo principal es familiarizar a los participantes con RStudio y sus características clave para generar informes reproducibles. Guiaremos a los asistentes a través del proceso de creación y gestión de proyectos en RStudio y les presentaremos la creación de manuscritos reproducibles utilizando documentos Quarto. El taller utilizará un conjunto de datos disponible públicamente de los CDC, que contiene información sobre el uso de drogas y la ideación suicida entre adolescentes, como un ejemplo práctico del uso de R para la investigación académica en salud pública. Explicaremos cómo utilizar funciones como filtrar, mutar, resumir y seleccionar del conjunto de paquetes tidyverse. Concluiremos demostrando cómo usar ggplot2 para crear visualizaciones en R. Al final del taller, los participantes habrán creado un documento reproducible en formato HTML, detallando los pasos de limpieza de datos y el análisis de un problema social contemporáneo importante. Esta presentación tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha en la alfabetización en programación entre los investigadores de habla hispana y promover métodos para la investigación científica reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalina Cañizares es una científica de datos apasionada y candidata Ph.D. en trabajo social.

In this workshop, Bruno Rodrigues will introduce participants to Nix, a package manager that focuses on reproducible builds. Unlike other solutions, Nix takes care of all the layers of reproducibility by ensuring that not only R packages are correctly versioned, but also R itself, as well as any other system-level dependency. With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace containerization tools such as Docker, and Nix can be used on any operating system, as well as on CI/CD platforms. To make Nix more accessible to beginners, Bruno wrote an R package called {rix}, which he will cover with hands-on exercices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruno Rodrigues is a statistician at Luxembourg’s Ministry of Research and Higher Education.
