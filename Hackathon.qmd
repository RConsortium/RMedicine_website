## About the Hackathon

We are excited to host a **Pharmaverse Hackathon** as part of R/Medicine 2026! This is a collaborative event where participants contribute to open-source R packages in the [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/){target="_blank"} ecosystem, a collection of packages designed to support clinical reporting workflows in the pharmaceutical industry.

Whether you're new to open source or a seasoned contributor, there's a track for you.

## Tracks

The hackathon follows two tracks to accommodate different experience levels:

### Track A: Good First Issues

Ideal for **newcomers** to open-source contribution. You'll work on beginner-friendly issues that help you get comfortable with the contribution workflow, forking repos, creating branches, opening pull requests, and more.

### Track B: Feature-Level Issues

For **advanced contributors** ready to tackle more substantial work. Participants in this track will work in pairs or mini-teams on feature-level issues that require deeper understanding of package architecture and R programming.

## Recommended Preparation

To get the most out of the hackathon, we strongly recommend attending the following workshop offered during R/Medicine 2026:

**R Packages for Personal Use with GitHub** (Wednesday, April 8th, 11:00 AM -- 1:00 PM ET). Learn how to create R packages and host them on GitHub. This workshop provides excellent preparation for the hackathon by familiarizing you with R package structure, development workflows, and GitHub-based collaboration.

Additionally, review the recording of **Dony Unardi's** workshop from R/Medicine 2025 on the [teal package](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/latest-tag/){target="_blank"}: *"https://r-consortium.org/posts/teal-mastery-from-pre-built-modules-to-custom-module-creation/"*, which covers one of the key pharmaverse packages.

## Prerequisites for Participants

To ensure a smooth and productive hackathon experience, please complete the following setup **before** the event.

### Technical Setup

- **R & IDE**: Install a working version of R and your preferred IDE (RStudio, VSCode, or Positron). Consider [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/){target="_blank"} as a free option.
- **Git & GitHub**:
    - Ensure you can log into [GitHub](https://github.com){target="_blank"}
    - Set up your GitHub account with appropriate tokens for pushing and pulling (e.g., personal access tokens or SSH keys)
    - If you use multiple git instances (e.g., an internal GitHub), configure git with your username and email:

      ```bash
      git config --global user.name "Your Name"
      git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
      ```

### R Familiarity

- **Track A** (Good First Issues): Participants with any level of R knowledge are welcome.
- **Track B** (Feature-Level Issues): Participants should be comfortable with:
    - How R packages are structured
    - Functional programming in R and relevant testing methods
    - Working collaboratively in pairs or small teams

### Git Familiarity

Working knowledge of git workflows is expected:

- Know how to **fork and clone** a repository
- Be able to **create branches**, commit changes, and push updates
- Understand how to **open a pull request** (PR)

Helpful resources:

- [Git tutorials 1](TBD){target="_blank"}
- [Git usage guide from an established pharmaverse package](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/CONTRIBUTING.html){target="_blank"}

### Environment & Access

- Confirm you can **clone and run** the target package locally
- Resolve any required **proxy or access restrictions** ahead of time
- Install all **package dependencies** listed in the onboarding materials

## At Kickoff

During the kickoff session, you will:

1. **Read through** the `CONTRIBUTING.md` and coding standards for your chosen package
2. **Review** the list of identified issues and features
3. **Join** the communication channel (Slack/Teams) and introduce yourself
4. **Pick an issue** and start contributing!
